README

	Lichtenstien Generator is as it says: a generator of Lictenstein style art 
	from pre existing images. Find out how to use the generator by reading the
	UserManual.pdf. The installation is as simple as having Python2.7 and
	Pillow2.5 installed on your machine.

NOTICE

	I most likely won't make any changes to the program from now as it's an 
	old assignment I completed for my course (Computer Visualisation 
	& Animation) at the NCCA. The final version was published on 
	06/06/2015.
    
	Also, it has not been optimised at all so it will be slow with large 
	images. Bare that in mind when using the program, if it takes forever it 
	may have either crashed from a memory shortage or is still taking its time 
	to complete the process.
